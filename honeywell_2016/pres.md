## Just another DIVINE?

DIVINE 

- explicit-state model checker

    - safety properties (memory safety, assertion safety)
    
    - LTL properties

- multiple input formalisms, main focus on LLVM

- supports almost all C/C++ features (including exception handling,
  threads, dynamic memory and standard library)
  
- efficiently utilizes all available resources to speed up the verification
  tasks
  
\pause

So why do we need "another DIVINE"?

\pause

- DIVINE can verify only programs with no inputs from the outside world 
  -- so-called "closed programs"

## SymDIVINE

- Control-Explicit/Data-Symbolic model checker

    - assertion safety
    
    - LTL properties

- single input formalism -- LLVM

- **can verify open programs**

- main focus on verification of real-world parallel C/C++ programs

- bitprecise verification

- can be downloaded at [https://github.com/yaqwsx/SymDivine](https://github.com/yaqwsx/SymDivine)


## Control-Explicit/Data-Symbolic model checker

- combination of approaches from standard explicit model-checking and
  symbolic execution

- generate and explore state-space of the verified program

    - control-flow is handled explicitly
    
    - data are handled symbolically

## Symbolic execution

- emulation of the program execution

- values of the variables are kept symbolically instead of explicit values

- this allows us to test all runs for arbitrary input values

    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    program            & explicit run        & symbolic representation  \\ \hline
    \texttt{x = input()}   &                     &                          \\
                       & $x = 3$             & $x = \alpha$             \\
    \texttt{x = x * 2} &                     &                          \\
                       & $x = 6$             & $x=2\cdot\alpha$         \\
    \texttt{x = x + 1} &                     &                          \\
                       & $x = 7$             & $x=(2\cdot\alpha) + 1$   \\
    \texttt{output(x)} &                     &                          \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
\end{latex}

## Symbolic execution

- conditions in program leads to branching

    - each branch has to be explored $\rightarrow$ exponential growth

- no detection of already visited locations $\rightarrow$ potentialy infinite branches

\pause

- consider following simple C program:

\centering

```C
x = input();
x += 5;
if (x > 0)
    y = input();
else
    y = 10;    
if (x > 2)
    assert(y != 42);
```

## Symbolic execution

## Set-based reduction

Main idea: keep control flow explicit, treat data symbolically

- state-space of verified program consists of multi-states

- each multi-state represents a single control flow location and a set
  of possible data valuations
  
    - one multi-state represents multiple explicit states
  
- set of data valuations can be represented by:

    - intervals
    
    - BDDs
    
    - *SMT formulae*

- **it is possible to decide whether two states represent the same
  data valuation**
  
- these properties of multi-states allows us to reuse existing algorithms
  from explicit model checking

## Set-based reduction

    int a = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
    if (a < 65535) {
        ...
    }
    else {
        ...
    }
        
\pause

    %a = call i32 @__VERIFIER_nondet_int()
    %b = icmp sge i32 %a, 65535
    br i1 %b, label %5, label %6

## Input formalism overview

SymDIVINE supports LLVM as input formalism

- LLVM can be easily obtained from C/C++ using Clang

- implementation of the subset of pthread library (threads, mutexes)

- C-style or SV-COMP style assertions

- input represented by \texttt{\_\_VERIFIER\_nondet\_\{type\}} functions

- atomic sections of code can be represented by \texttt{\_\_VERIFIER\_atomic\_\{begin,end\}} functions

# Demonstration

## Example of usage -- assertion reachability

- benchmark \texttt{stateful01\_true-unreach-call}

- call \texttt{./symdivine reachability stateful01\_true-unreach-call.ll}

## Example of usage -- LTL

- benchmark \texttt{acqrel}

- property $\mathcal{G}(A\Rightarrow\mathcal{F}R)$ (property can refer to any global variable)

 - call \texttt{./symdivine ltl "G([seg1\_off1 != 0(32)] => F [seg1\_off0 != 0(32)])" acqrel.ll}

## Advantages of SymDIVINE

- real world code verification with no need for modelling

- can verify program with infinite behavior unlike symbolic execution

- bitprecise verification

    - other tools often use integral instead of bitvector representation
    
- pthread library support

- in theory no false positives

## Disadvantages of SymDIVINE

- currently no support for LLVM debug information (plan to be implemented or solved in another way)

    - counterexamples refere to internal representation with no link to source code
    
    - atomic proposition of LTL properties have to be linked against LLVM variables

- no support for symbolic pointer arithmetics and dynamic memory

- loops that deeply depend on input value may need unrolling

## Future work

- SymDIVINE supports verification of programs with inputs,
  however it lacks strong background for:

    - full LLVM support
    
    - dynamic memory
    
    - counterexamples refering to source code
    
- DIVINE offers solution to almost all of these problems

\pause

- There are plans for merge of these two tools
